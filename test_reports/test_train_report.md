**Runtime:** 0.22s (sum of relevant durations)

### `test_train_function`
- **What:** Integration test for the `train()` function.
- **Why:** To ensure that a single training step can be executed without raising an exception.
- **Specifically Tested:** Called the `train()` function with a model, a small data loader, an optimizer, and an epoch number.
- **Test Data Rationale:** A small subset of the MNIST dataset (10 samples) was used to create the `DataLoader`. This makes the test run quickly while still verifying the integration of the components.

### `test_test_function`
- **What:** Integration test for the `evaluate()` function.
- **Why:** To ensure that the evaluation function can be executed without raising an exception.
- **Specifically Tested:** Called the `evaluate()` function with a model and a small data loader.
- **Test Data Rationale:** Similar to the training test, a small subset of the MNIST dataset (10 samples) was used for speed.
